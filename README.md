# Development work flow
This Application is for the backend side of news aggregator.
1. DB - MariaDB
    I created three tables - Users, Settings, Articles

    Users - storing user info - Id, Name, Email, Created Date

    Settings - storing user's preference info - Type, Name
        (ex: I like `author` called `Will Millar` => Type = `author` Name = `Will Millar` )

    Articles - storing the news info - Id, Source Name, Source, Author, Title, Category, Description, URL, Image, Created Date

2. Laravel
    - Auth Controller

        Login and Register

        These apis are public means everyone can access and will create a new user and send the token for the logged in users.

    - Articles Controller

        These are the private apis means only authorized users can access.

        - Articles

            You can fetch the articles filtered or searched by title, authors, categories, and sources.

        - Settings
            CRUD operations for user settings
            You can add, delete, update, and fetch the user settings with these apis.
